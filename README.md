# JazzSvelte

`JazzSvelte` is an "under contruction" project. The goal is to create a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) version of the excellent [PrimeReact](https://primereact.org/) library  (a rich set of open source UI Components). The dom structure generated by `JazzSvlete` is the same than [PrimeReact](https://primereact.org/) so `JazzSvlete` is compliant with [PrimeReact](https://primereact.org/) themes.

I started this project because I was looking for a motivating project to develop with  [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). It also happens that I love the prime REACT framework and its wealth of components (Thanks to the entire prime REACT team for the enormous work done on their framework).

## Current state

The [PrimeReact](https://primereact.org/) documentation website is migrated to `JazzSvelte` using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). This website is used to evaluate migrated component (It's also usefull for development). The list of migrated component is :
- **Form**
   - InputText [PrimeReact version](https://primereact.org/inputtext/)
- **Button**
   - Button [PrimeReact version](https://primereact.org/button/)
   - SpeedDial [PrimeReact version](https://primereact.org/speeddial/)
   - SplitButton [PrimeReact version](https://primereact.org/splitbutton/)
- **Panel**
   - Panel [PrimeReact version](https://primereact.org/panel/)
- **Overlay**
   - Tooltip [PrimeReact version](https://primereact.org/tooltip/)
- **Menu**
    - TieredMenu  [PrimeReact version](https://primereact.org/tooltip/)
- **Messages**
   - Toast [PrimeReact version](https://primereact.org/toast/)
- **Misc**
   - Avatar [PrimeReact version](https://primereact.org/avatar/)
   - Icons
   - Ripple [PrimeReact version](https://primereact.org/ripple/)

A migrated component is a set of content:
- The ts/svelte code of the component
- The test files (Done using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/))
- The documentation migrated

## Theming

JazzSvelte has two theming has modes; styled or unstyled.

**Styled Mode**

Styled mode is based on pre-skinned components with opinionated themes like Material, Bootstrap or PrimeOne themes. Theme is the required css file to be imported, visit the [Themes](https://jazzsvelte.org/theming) section for the complete list of available themes to choose from.

**Unstyled Mode**

Unstyled mode is disabled by default for all components. Using the jazzsvelte context, set `unstyled` as true to enable it globally. Visit the [Unstyled mode](https://jazzsvelte.org/unstyled) documentation for more information and examples.
